  <li> "My favorite machine learning book just received a face-lift! 'Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction' is the most comprehensive and accessible book on modern machine learning by a large margin. 
It now also covers the latest developments in deep learning and causal discovery. With this upgrade it will remain the reference book for our field that every respected researcher needs to have on their desk." -- <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/">Max Welling</a>, U. Amsterdam
